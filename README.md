## My Process

### Built With

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the layout and components.
- **Flexbox**: For creating flexible and responsive layouts.
- **CSS Grid**: For more complex grid-based layouts.
- **SASS**: For writing modular and maintainable CSS with variables, mixins, and nesting.

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I learned and practiced the following:

- How to use **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** together to create responsive layouts.
- How to organize and structure **SASS** files for better maintainability.
- How to implement responsive images and media queries for different screen sizes.
- The importance of semantic HTML and accessibility best practices.

### Continued Development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- Improving my understanding of advanced CSS animations and transitions.
- Exploring more advanced SASS features like functions and loops.
- Enhancing accessibility and performance optimizations.
